## For the reader

Below I go over a bunch of design problems/decisions while developing this library.

I've written this assuming the reader knows about:
* [kdtree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree)
* [sweep and prune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_and_prune)
* [quad tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree) 


The source code for this book is the repo [dinotree_report](https://github.com/tiby312/dinotree_report) on github.
